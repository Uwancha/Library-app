# Library-app

This project was created as part of the JavaScript Full-Stack Web Developer program on The Odin Project. The main purpose of this project is to apply the lessons learned about constructors in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses constructor functions to create book objects and store them in an array. The DOM is manipulated using JavaScript to display the books on the webpage and add/remove them from the library.

## Features

- Add new books to the library
- Remove existing books from the library
- Mark books as read or unread

## Usage

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a form where you can enter information about a new book, such as its title, author, and number of pages. Click the "Add Book" button to add the book to your library.

You can view all of your existing books in the table below the form. To remove a book from your library, click the "Remove" button next to that book's row.
